Creating a **Base Model** for Cassandra in Laravel that mimics the functionality and relations of Eloquent is a challenging but achievable task. Since Cassandra is a NoSQL database, it doesn't support joins, foreign keys, or some of the advanced relational database concepts that Eloquent provides. However, you can still build a custom ORM-like system that handles many of the key features of Eloquent.

Let's go step by step and design a **Base Model** for Cassandra that mimics Eloquent's relationships (like one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.), query scopes, and other essential features.

### 1. **Set Up the Cassandra Connection**

First, we need to make sure that we have a connection to Cassandra via the PHP driver.

- Install the **Cassandra PHP driver**:
  ```bash
  composer require datastax/php-driver
  ```

- Create a service provider to manage the Cassandra connection (as shown previously).

- Define the Cassandra connection settings in `config/cassandra.php`.

### 2. **Creating the BaseModel**

We'll create a **BaseModel** class that mimics the structure of Laravel's Eloquent model, with additional methods for interacting with Cassandra.

#### Base Model Code:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Cassandra;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Cassandra\Cluster;
use Cassandra\SimpleStatement;

class CassandraModel extends Model
{
    protected $connection = 'cassandra';  // Name of the connection
    protected $primaryKey = 'id';         // Default primary key
    public $timestamps = false;           // Cassandra doesn't support timestamps natively

    // Set up connection to Cassandra
    protected function query($query, $params = [])
    {
        $connection = app('Cassandra');
        $statement = new SimpleStatement($query);

        return $connection->execute($statement, $params);
    }

    // Fetch all rows for the model's table
    public static function all()
    {
        $model = new static();
        $table = $model->getTable();
        $query = "SELECT * FROM {$table}";
        return $model->query($query);
    }

    // Save a model to Cassandra
    public function save()
    {
        $columns = implode(', ', array_keys($this->attributes));
        $values = implode(', ', array_map(function ($value) {
            return "'" . addslashes($value) . "'";
        }, array_values($this->attributes)));

        $table = $this->getTable();
        $query = "INSERT INTO {$table} ({$columns}) VALUES ({$values})";

        return $this->query($query);
    }

    // Update an existing record
    public function update()
    {
        $setClause = implode(', ', array_map(function ($column, $value) {
            return "{$column} = '" . addslashes($value) . "'";
        }, array_keys($this->attributes), array_values($this->attributes)));

        $table = $this->getTable();
        $query = "UPDATE {$table} SET {$setClause} WHERE {$this->primaryKey} = '{$this->attributes[$this->primaryKey]}'";

        return $this->query($query);
    }

    // Delete the current record
    public function delete()
    {
        $table = $this->getTable();
        $query = "DELETE FROM {$table} WHERE {$this->primaryKey} = '{$this->attributes[$this->primaryKey]}'";
        return $this->query($query);
    }

    // Retrieve a record by its primary key
    public static function find($id)
    {
        $model = new static();
        $table = $model->getTable();
        $query = "SELECT * FROM {$table} WHERE {$model->primaryKey} = ?";
        $result = $model->query($query, [$id]);
        return $result ? $result[0] : null;
    }

    // Get the table name (based on the model class name)
    public function getTable()
    {
        return strtolower(class_basename($this));  // Returns the model name in lowercase as the table name
    }

    // Add a custom query scope
    public function scopeWhere($query, $column, $value)
    {
        return $query->where($column, '=', $value);
    }
}
```

### 3. **Relationships in Cassandra (NoJoins)**

Cassandra does not support joins or foreign key constraints. Instead, you typically denormalize your data and manage relations through your application logic.

#### One-to-Many Relationship (Denormalized)

In Cassandra, a **one-to-many** relationship is typically represented by storing the related data (e.g., a list of IDs or documents) in a collection column or separate table.

For example, if a **User** has many **Posts**, you might store posts with a user_id in the same table, or create a separate `user_posts` table. Here's how you might implement a basic one-to-many relation:

#### User Model (One-to-Many)

```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\CassandraModel;

class User extends CassandraModel
{
    protected $fillable = ['user_id', 'name', 'email'];

    // One-to-Many: Get all posts for a user (denormalized example)
    public function posts()
    {
        $query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = ?";
        return $this->query($query, [$this->user_id]);
    }
}
```

#### Post Model (One-to-Many)

```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\CassandraModel;

class Post extends CassandraModel
{
    protected $fillable = ['post_id', 'user_id', 'title', 'content'];
}
```

#### Example Usage:

```php
// Get all posts for user with ID 1
$user = User::find(1);
$posts = $user->posts();
```

---

### 4. **Many-to-Many Relationships**

For a **many-to-many** relationship, you will have to manage the link between models manually. This often involves creating an intermediary table. In Cassandra, this can be done by adding collections (lists, sets, etc.) or by creating a linking table.

For instance, if **Users** and **Groups** have a many-to-many relationship:

#### User Model (Many-to-Many)

```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\CassandraModel;

class User extends CassandraModel
{
    protected $fillable = ['user_id', 'name', 'email'];

    // Many-to-Many: Get groups the user belongs to
    public function groups()
    {
        $query = "SELECT * FROM user_groups WHERE user_id = ?";
        return $this->query($query, [$this->user_id]);
    }
}
```

#### Group Model (Many-to-Many)

```php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Models\CassandraModel;

class Group extends CassandraModel
{
    protected $fillable = ['group_id', 'name'];

    // Many-to-Many: Get users in the group
    public function users()
    {
        $query = "SELECT * FROM user_groups WHERE group_id = ?";
        return $this->query($query, [$this->group_id]);
    }
}
```

You would need a **`user_groups`** table that holds the relationships between users and groups.

---

### 5. **Scopes and Filtering**

You can define custom query scopes in your **BaseModel** to make querying easier. Here's an example of how to implement a query scope like **`where`**:

```php
// In your BaseModel
public function scopeWhere($query, $column, $value)
{
    return $query->where($column, '=', $value);
}

// Usage in a model (for example, User)
$users = User::where('email', '=', 'john.doe@example.com')->get();
```

---

### 6. **Pagination**

Since Cassandra doesn't support pagination in the same way that traditional databases do, youâ€™ll need to manually handle paginated queries using token-based pagination (using the `SELECT ... LIMIT` and `TOKEN()` functionality).

Example:

```php
public function paginate($limit = 10, $startToken = null)
{
    $query = "SELECT * FROM {$this->getTable()}";
    if ($startToken) {
        $query .= " WHERE TOKEN({$this->primaryKey}) > ?";
    }
    $query .= " LIMIT {$limit}";

    $params = $startToken ? [$startToken] : [];

    return $this->query($query, $params);
}
```

---

### Conclusion

This **BaseModel** for Cassandra provides an abstraction that mimics the features of **Laravel Eloquent**. However, there are key differences due to Cassandra's NoSQL nature, such as the lack of JOINs, foreign key constraints, and relational data. 

The relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) have to be managed manually, often through denormalization or using separate tables for linking records. Moreover, pagination and complex filtering need to be handled differently in Cassandra, as it is optimized for distributed, high-performance queries.

With these concepts, you can begin to build a more sophisticated ORM-like layer for Cassandra in Laravel, while keeping in mind the best practices for designing NoSQL databases.
